# ML_Classification_models_Booking-Cancelation
Predicting booking cancellation or not

The goal in this project is to develop a model for predicting if a booking is going to be cancelled or not.

For this purpose, we have a dataset with several features:

hotel
is_canceled
lead_time
arrival_date_year
arrival_date_month
arrival_date_week_number
arrival_date_day_of_month
stays_in_weekend_nights
stays_in_week_nights
